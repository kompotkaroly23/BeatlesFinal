        <h2>Imagine</h2>
        <p>Imagine there's no heaven<br />
            It's easy if you try<br />
            No hell below us<br /> 
            Above us, only sky<br />
            Imagine all the people<br /> 
            Livin' for today<br />
            Ah<br />
            Imagine there's no countries<br />
            It isn't hard to do<br />
            Nothing to kill or die for<br />
            And no religion, too<br />
            Imagine all the people<br />
            Livin' life in peace<br />
            You<br />
            You may say I'm a dreamer<br />
            But I'm not the only one<br />
            I hope someday you'll join us<br />
            And the world will be as one<br />
            Imagine no possessions<br />
            I wonder if you can<br />
            No need for greed or hunger<br />
            A brotherhood of man<br />
            Imagine all the people<br />
            Sharing all the world<br />
            You<br />
            You may say I'm a dreamer<br />
            But I'm not the only one<br />
            I hope someday you'll join us<br />
            And the world will live as one<br />
